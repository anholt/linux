Broadcom VC4 GPU

The VC4 device present on the Raspberry Pi includes a display system
with HDMI output and the HVS scaler for compositing display planes.

Required properties for VC4:
- compatible:	Should be "brcm,vc4"
- crtcs:	List of phandles of pixelvalve scanout engines
- hvss:		List of phandles of HVS video scalers
- encoders:	List of phandles of output encoders (HDMI, SDTV)

Required properties for Pixel Valve:
- compatible:	Should be "brcm,vc4-pixelvalve"
- reg:		Physical base address and length of the PV's registers
- interrupts:	The interrupt number
		  See bindings/interrupt-controller/brcm,bcm2835-armctrl-ic.txt

Required properties for HVS:
- compatible:	Should be "brcm,vc4-hvs"
- reg:		Physical base address and length of the HVS's registers
- interrupts:	The interrupt number
		  See bindings/interrupt-controller/brcm,bcm2835-armctrl-ic.txt

Required properties for HDMI
- compatible:	Should be "brcm,vc4-hdmi"
- reg:		Physical base address and length of the two register ranges
		  ("HDMI" and "HD", in that order)
- interrupts:	The interrupt numbers
		  See bindings/interrupt-controller/brcm,bcm2835-armctrl-ic.txt
- ddc:		phandle of the I2C controller used for DDC EDID probing
- crtc:		phandle to the pixelvalve CRTC the HDMI encoder is attached to

Optional properties for HDMI:
- hpd-gpio:	The GPIO pin for HDMI hotplug detect (if it doesn't appear
		  as an interrupt/status bit in the HDMI controller
		  itself).  See bindings/pinctrl/brcm,bcm2835-gpio.txt
