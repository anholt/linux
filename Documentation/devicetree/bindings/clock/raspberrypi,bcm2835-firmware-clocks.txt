Raspberry Pi firmware clock provider.

The Raspberry Pi architecture doesn't provide direct access to the
CLOCKMAN peripheral from the ARM side, so Linux has to make requests
to the VPU firmware to program them.

This binding uses the common clock binding:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be "raspberrypi,bcm2835-firmware-clocks"

- #clock-cells:		Shall have value <1>.  The permitted clock-specifier
			  values can be found in
			  include/dt-bindings/clk/raspberrypi.h.

- raspberrypi,firmware:	Phandle to the firmware driver node.

Example:

firmware_clocks: firmware-clocks {
	compatible = "raspberrypi,bcm2835-firmware-clocks";
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	raspberrypi,firmware = <&firmware>;
};
